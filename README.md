# Breast Cancer Detection Project

## Scenario:
The objective of this project is to build a breast cancer detection system on CNNs. The system will be trained on a dataset of breast tissue images that have been labeled as either benign or malignant. The system will then be able to classify new breast tissue images as either benign or malignant.
